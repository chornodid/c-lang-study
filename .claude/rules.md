# Project Rules and Standards

## Markdown Formatting

### Linting Configuration

The project uses `.markdownlint.json` with the some overrides.

### General Guidelines

- Wrap long descriptions to multiple lines (max 80 chars per line)
- Use proper markdown syntax for all formatting
- Keep code blocks readable with syntax highlighting
- Use tables for structured information
- Include file references with format: `filename:line_number`

## C Language Compilation

Find compiler and compilation flags in [compile-exercises](../compile-exercises)
Ruby script (COMPILER and COMPILER_FLAGS constants).
